# jarvis-line
A chatbot built on top of the LINE messaging platform’s Messaging API and Google’s Dialogflow. It integrates and scrapes data from various services and locations to provide numerous useful features.

The idea for this came from my personal peeve of not liking to need to think about where I need to find something; instead preferring to have as many things accessible from one location as possible.

Current feature set include:

- Current weather and condition
- Directions
- World Clock
- Movies in theaters and showtime
